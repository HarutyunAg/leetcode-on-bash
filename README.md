Unfortunatly __LeetCode__ doesn't provide built-in support for submitting your solution in __Bash__ scripts for most problems. This repository aims to fill that gap by offering solutions to __LeetCode__ problems using __Bash__.

__Project Status__: This repository is actively maintained and regularly updated with new solutions for LeetCode problems. If you have any suggestions or contributions, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
