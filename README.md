# LeetCode With Bash  ![leet-bash](https://github.com/HarutyunAg/leetcode-with-bash/assets/106912298/9e869ecb-359b-40a7-9d96-3ed96390e99b)

Unfortunatly __LeetCode__ doesn't provide built-in support for submitting your solution in __Bash__ scripts for most problems. This repository aims to fill that gap by offering solutions to __LeetCode__ problems using __Bash__.

__Project Status__: This repository is actively maintained and regularly updated with new solutions for LeetCode problems. If you have any suggestions or contributions, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
