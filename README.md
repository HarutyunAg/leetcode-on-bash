Unfortunatly __LeetCode__ doesn't provide built-in support for submitting your solution in __Bash__ scripts for most problems. This repository aims to fill that gap by offering solutions to __LeetCode__ problems using __Bash__.

1. One LeetCode Task - One Bash File:

        Each solution should be contained in its own Bash script file.

2. File Naming Convention:

        Use snake_case for file names, mirroring the LeetCode task name.

3. Positional Argument Support:
   
        The script should accept inputs from the command line and output the solution to the terminal.

4. Task Description and Example of Usage:

        Include a commented section at the beginning of each script with:
        - A task description.
        - Example of usage showcasing the input and expected output.
